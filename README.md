# Sassc Binaries

This repository holds precompiled binaries of sassc (https://github.com/sass/sassc),
a native sass compiler built upon libsass (https://github.com/sass/libsass).

I keep them here for use in my own projects, with no guarantee whatsoever. Feel free to use them though and report any problems.

# Important

Please note that not all binaries in this repo have been uploaded by me. Some have been kindly provided by folks that use this repo in their own projects (thank you!).

While I'm very grateful that people step up and update files __I do not take responsibility for the validity of the uploaded files!!!__

__Please be aware you use them at your own risk!__
