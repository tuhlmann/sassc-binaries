# Sassc Binaries

This repository holds precompiled binaries of sassc (https://github.com/sass/sassc),
a native sass compiler built upon libsass (https://github.com/sass/libsass).

I keep them here for use in my own projects, with no guarantee whatsoever. Feel free to use them though and report any problems.
